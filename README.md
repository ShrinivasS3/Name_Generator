# Name_Generator

This takes one text file as input, where each line is assumed to be one training element, and generates more things like it. Essentially, it is an autoregressive character-level language model with bigrams. For example, we can feed it a database of names, and it will generate name ideas that all sound name-like but are not already existing names.
